# Project Idea

## A Lightweight Mobile Sign Language Recognition System.

## Idea: 
I want my project to be able to recognize basic sign language gestures —  like "C", "E", "L", "O", "V" — in real time, using the camera and a lightweight deep learning model on my smartphone.

## Data:
This project combines open-source datasets with self-collected samples.
